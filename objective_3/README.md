### Objective 3

For this objective edit objective_3.py and implement the function named `convert` so that it converts the temperature given in Fahrenheit to Celsius, rounded to one decimal place.

The formula to convert from degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius is:

C = (F-32) * 5/9

Note: when you are ready to have pytest evaluate your code, remove the first line comment from the objective_3.py file.
